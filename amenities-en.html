                         Insurance System：
                            </h1>
                            <p>
                                 Nowadays, Thailand has become the world's largest tourism medical destination. More than 2 million people visit Thailand
                                every year for medical services. Here, many private hospitals have a five-star hotel-like medical environment and services:
                                magnificent lighting, colorful fountains, gorgeous halls, and the air is full of Starbucks coffee smells. Outside the window,
                                there are silver sands and blue water stretch far away. Many hospitals collaborating with Seven Stars International Resort
                                offer a variety of medical insurance options to erase your worries: Thailand's medical insurance is mostly global claims,
                                so even if you return home, you could still claim compensation. Its medical insurance mainly includes medical expenses caused
                                by accidents, hospital-generated wards, treatment costs, laboratory tests, minor operations and other cost claims. After
                                presenting your insurance card directly when you seek medical treatment could simply be done at the hospital. Hospitals will
                                charge the bill directly to your insurance companies.

                                 Living in harmony with water is a world-recognized model of livability that has been proven by history. From the Summer
                                Palace to Mohs Manor, from Fontainebleau to Hyde Park, from ancient imperial palaces to modern high-quality communities,
                                it has been commonly recommended as to build community landscapes centered on water systems. However, Seven Stars International
                                Resort is not just limited to “taking water as a sight”, but also creating a water-friendly community system, where the main
                                park could be used as a water park where you could enjoy surfing! The entire park is pavilion-style, with clear streams around
                                the huge islands. Leisure water parks, swimming pools and tropical trees and flowers, built up an unique and elegant lifestyle
                                for our residents.
